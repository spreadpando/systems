Max Jitter is a library of tools for manipulating RGBA matrices in realtime. Combining sound and 3D graphic design in a cohesive programming environment, Max/MSP/Jitter is my primary creative outlet. I will be adding here a collection of experimental Max4Live patches for use in Ableton Live 9 and 10. These patches are intended for performance and sample generation, their functions range from MIDI note generation and quantization to sample manipulation and playback.",

The grove is 80.000 years old and its 20.000 tree stems share a conjoined root system, constituting one of the largest organisms on earth. Ecological changes now threaten the posterity of this giant. A standing testament and tacit witness to the primordial shaping of the American West, Pando shrinks as a result of disease and seasonal climate change/n./n./n./n DEVELOPMENT/n pando.systems is a repository of projects produced by a designer from Colorado whose work is inspired by nature, evolution and collective conciousness. I work in sound and music,front end and UX development. I develop self contained systems and tools for experimental media development. This website is built in React using webpack 4, css-in-js (styled-components), and threejs.
