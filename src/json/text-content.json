		"text": "CONCEPT/n PANDO is the name given to a grove of trembling aspen trees in Utah which share a conjoined root system. The grove is 80.000 years old and its 20.000 tree stems share a conjoined root system, constituting one of the largest organisms on earth. Ecological changes now threaten the posterity of this giant. A standing testament and tacit witness to the primordial shaping of the American West, Pando shrinks as a result of disease and seasonal climate change. /n*/n DEVELOPMENT/n PANDO.SYSTEMS is a repository of projects produced by a designer from Colorado whose work is inspired by nature, evolution and collective conciousness. I work in sound and music,front end and UX development. I develop self contained systems and tools for experimental media development. This website is built in React using webpack 4, css-in-js (styled-components), and threejs. I am also familiar with python, MIDI, OSC & Unity as well as most industry wireframing / prototyping and DAW softwares and outboard audio gear."
